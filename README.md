# Home-Loan-Default
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project analyzes a Home Loan Default dataset to understand the factors that influence loan repayment behavior and to build predictive models that classify applicants as likely to repay or default on their loans.
It aims to support lenders in making data-driven, fair, and efficient credit approval decisions.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset contains information about loan applicants and their repayment status.
Typical features include:

Applicant demographics (age, gender, marital status, dependents)

Employment details and income

Loan amount, term, and property area

Credit history

Loan status (target: Default / No Default)

Note: Ensure proper handling of missing values, categorical variables, and imbalanced classes before modeling.

ðŸ§­ Project Workflow

Data Collection & Understanding

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handle missing values

Encode categorical variables

Scale numerical features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize distributions and correlations

Identify outliers and trends

Model Development

Train models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Address data imbalance (SMOTE / class weights)

Model Evaluation

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

Deployment (Optional)

Deploy best model using Streamlit or Flask for real-time predictions

ðŸš© Challenges

Missing or inconsistent data

Highly imbalanced target variable

Ensuring interpretability for financial decision-making

Avoiding bias and complying with fair-lending regulations

ðŸ“Š Key Findings

Credit history is the strongest predictor of default.

Applicants with higher income-to-loan ratios are less likely to default.

Shorter loan terms tend to correlate with better repayment behavior.

ðŸ’» Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost

Deployment: Streamlit / Flask (optional)
